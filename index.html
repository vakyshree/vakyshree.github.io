									<h3>Information Gathering</h3>
								</div>	
								<div id="content_pg_4_0">
									<div id="img_pg_4_0"></div>
									<p>This is the first step where we discuss the ideas and expectations of client from the project.
After fully understanding the client needs we make an effort to bring their vision and ours together to yield the best possible results.
We tend to plan every feature in core detail to avoid future confusion whilst understanding the targeted user base.
Later we also provide clients with unique username and passkey to monitor project progress.
Complete Quotation will be sent via email after completion of initial discussion.

</p>

									<h3>Setting Scheduled meeting</h3>
								</div>	
								<div id="content_pg_4_0">
									<div id="img_pg_4_1"></div>
									<p>Time is money, and wasted time means a lot less money. Therefore, we take planning and timeliness very seriously in order to deliver projects before deadlines. Dates and timings will be provided early on for discussions and project reports. 
UML diagrams will be used for better communication so that the clients get a clear understanding of the functionality behind complex features as well as to plan and discuss things to their minor details.
Major changes related to designs and model can be accepted in the initial phase. Things will be more flexible before completion of the core structure.
